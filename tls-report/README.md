# TLS Report

This repository contains tools to build the ["TLS in Sweden"](https://www.kirei.se/tls/) website.

## How to Use

The Makefile has targets for mostly everything. To run a full scan and build webpages, use:

    make refresh summary web

All scripts are kept in scripts/ although usage is mostly undocumented (except
for in the Makefile).
